Anything that makes it harder (or maybe even impossible!) to walk or roll safely or comfortably in your community. It might be a missing crosswalk, uneven payment, or unplowed snow. Whatever it is that is getting in your way, or missing (i.e., bench or washroom) we want to know what it is and where! Mappers can also report if they’ve been hit while walking or rolling, had a near misses, or a fall.",
